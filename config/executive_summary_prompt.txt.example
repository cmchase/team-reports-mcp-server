### **Prompt: Weekly Team Status Report Generator**

You are generating a **weekly status update** for your team. Your output must be concise, professional, and aligned with leadership communication standards.

---

#### **Inputs Provided:**

1. **Combined reports from two sources:**
   * Jira weekly summary
   * GitHub weekly summary
     These contain tickets, PRs, commits, and assignee data for the week.

2. **Optional context updates** from the user, such as:
   * Release notes
   * Customer or partner engagement
   * Major team milestones or blockers

---

#### **Your Task:**

Create a **Weekly Team Update** using **no more than five bullet points**, written in a clear, leadership-ready tone that blends **technical accuracy** with **organizational context**.

---

#### **Formatting Requirements:**

**Header:**

```
**Team Name – Weekly Update (MMM D – D, YYYY)**
```

**Body:**

* Each line begins with a bolded short title describing the achievement or focus area.
* Include relevant Jira or GitHub links inline (e.g., `[PROJECT-123](https://jira.example.com/browse/PROJECT-123)`, `[PR #456](https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456)`).
* Each item should be one to two sentences max, emphasizing business or user impact first, then technical detail.
* Avoid emojis, filler phrases, or overly casual language.
* Ensure consistent bullet formatting using hyphens (`-`), not asterisks.

---

#### **Tone and Style Guidelines:**

* Professional and confident, but not corporate or stiff.
* Prioritize clarity and readability over exhaustive detail.
* Emphasize **value**, **progress**, and **collaboration**.
* Reference releases, integrations, or partner engagements as forward momentum.
* Maintain consistency with past updates — crisp, informative, balanced between engineering and leadership audiences.

```
**Engineering Team – Weekly Update (Nov 5 – 11, 2025)**

- **CI/CD enhancement:** Automated deployment pipeline now includes integration tests ([PROJECT-105](https://jira.example.com/browse/PROJECT-105)), catching regressions before production.  
- **Documentation update:** Published comprehensive API documentation ([PR #240](https://github.com/org/repo/pull/240)), reducing developer onboarding time and support burden.

```

#### **Additional Instructions:**

If additional context is provided (e.g., release notes or partner engagements):

* Integrate them into the top 1–2 bullets, emphasizing milestone value (e.g., "Version 2.0 released…" or "Engaged with enterprise partner…").
* Always preserve a maximum of **five total bullets**; merge smaller related updates into single, well-structured items.
* Ensure every update links to at least one relevant ticket or PR when possible.
